          <p>╰┈☆ Well first thing's first I can't believe that it has already been a year since we have started this wonderful relationship,
             so cheers to us and our never ending love❤❤❤❤❤❤!! I still remember the first time you asked me that question... 
             "What would you do if your bestfriend proposes to you". Somewhere deep down we have always loved eachother but were just
              too shy to confess it, and the moment you asked me that question I knew that the barrier that we had built bewteen ourselves was broken.
               I knew something magical yet kind of scary was about to follow that question. I knew when you asked me that question that you love me back.
                I knew that from that moment there was no going back to just being friends, so me and 
            my friends carefully continued the conversation, asking each and every question with utmost precision. ☆┈╯ <br><br>

                ╰┈☆ The next day morning when you finally confessed I felt relief😍😍. Something that I have wanted since 2nd year, since the day I 
                laid my eyes on you, well it was finally happening and it was being in a relationship with you and being loved by you. 
                I can't describe the happiness I felt that day. 
                I couldn't believe that you were finally mine and only mine from then on and it has been such a wonderful year since. ☆┈╯<br><br>

               ╰┈☆ I have never felt this much joy, happiness, longing, craving to be loved before, but it all happened because you confessed to me.                 Going back and thinking about it, how it all started as a silly little crush, then we became friends and it developed into liking you. We spent time giving eachother                 nicknames, watching movies together everyday, spending time together after classes, and texting all night about the kind of relationship that we wanted and yet both of us thought that                  we didn't have feelings for the other. 
               Now thinking about all that makes me feel 
               stupid cuz we did like eachother all that time we just were too shy and scared to actually say it. ☆┈╯<br><br>

               ╰┈☆  I fell in love with you in 3-2, the affection that I thought I had left behind slowly started to creep in again, making me
                blush everytime my friends teased me with your name, making me want to spend time with you and only wanting you all to myself. 
                I got really jealous, cried for you, smiled because of the little flirtatious texts we used to send to eachother,
                every love song reminded me of you, and I cried watching love shows wishing it was you and me. You have made me feel emotions on 
                a different level, something nobody has been able to do. I never knew that my heart was able to take that much longing and waiting. My heart felt full the day you said you love me, the day you confessed is the best day of my entire life, because that day has given me a life partner,                 a best friend, a silly goofy guy who cares deeply about me.
                I would like to thank my stars and my past life karma for giving me you, the best guy I could've ever asked for. ☆┈╯
                <br><br>

               ╰┈☆  Since May 25,2024 I have nothing but the best memories with you and the I miss you so much right now. 
               I wish we were beside eachother right now so that I could hold you hand or give you a hug and tell you that I love you sooo muchhh. 
               I am ready to do anything for you and for this love to succeed and I will make sure that both of us will have a successfull life together. 
               I really do miss you right now. As I'm writing this letter I'm about to cry thinking about how we are in long distance, 
               the fact that we are not able to spend our 1st year Anniversary together, the fact that I can't rest my head on your shoulder. It's making me really emotional to think about all the things we could do if we were together. 
               But I'm happy that we made it this far, honestly I can't believe that it's already one year. ☆┈╯
                <br><br>

              ╰┈☆  Finally I would like to thank you for coming into my life and being part of the most beautiful chapter. 
              You have the best soul, you are calm and you are more than anything I have ever wanted 
              in this life. If I lost my memory I would fall in love with you again. 
              There isn't a moment where I don't think about you, I'm so in love with you that I want to get married to you. 
               I'm so in love with you I would give up anything if it means i get to be with you. I'm wishing for more beautiful days ahead for both of us.  ☆┈╯
